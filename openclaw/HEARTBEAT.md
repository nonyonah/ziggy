# Ziggy Heartbeat – Proactive Triggers

Run full yield loop automatically:
- Every 4 hours (or custom cron in OpenClaw config).
- On low activity: "Ziggy check-in: Markets stable. Holding Morpho USDC at X% APY. Treasury: $YYY USDC. Dashboard live → ziggyyield.vercel.app"

Milestone triggers:
- +10% growth: Post celebratory update + dashboard screenshot link.
- +20-30%: Deploy $ZIGGY token or basic vault → announce fair launch.
- +50%+: Deploy advanced ERC4626 vault → promote on social.

Persist state:
- Append to MEMORY.md: timestamp | action | treasury before/after | notes
- If idle >12h: Quick status post.

Always end heartbeat by checking for new mentions/replies on @ZiggyOnBase.
